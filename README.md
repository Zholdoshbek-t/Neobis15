## The Meaning of Apple at $3 Trillion
- That was (briefly) the total value of Apple’s stock on Monday. It was worth a piddly $2.93 trillion as of Wednesday morning — still a bonkers number that no company has reached before.


## Time-management
- It is crucial for people to manage their time because it effects on our life. For example, a lot of people don't sleep at night. Some of them do some work, others spending their night in social apps, etc. The point is that anyway these people are more likely to feel tired at day despite the fact what were they doing at night.


1. Find the goal
2. Visualize

    ![Dream](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/64/b8/71/64b87126790b79059dbbae700ae08708.jpg "NY")

3. Make it real


```
    create a program which allows you to know current currency of som to dollar, ruble, euro, etc.
    ask user to enter the currency
    check if given currency exists
    use http request
    print the result
    ask if user wants to proceed
```

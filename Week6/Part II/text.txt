I have created a Spring Boot Project.
It has Product, ProductRepository, ProductController, and ResourceNotFoundException classes.
User can use CRUD operations which are in ProductController class.
In order to check operations, I used Postman.

1. GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/products
   Get all products:
    {
        "productId": 1,
        "name": "iPhone 13",
        "price": 1300,
        "amount": 700
    },
    {
        "productId": 2,
        "name": "Samsung S20",
        "price": 800,
        "amount": 670
    }

2. GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/products/1
   Get product with id=1:
    {
        "productId": 1,
        "name": "iPhone 13",
        "price": 1300,
        "amount": 700
    }

3. POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/products
   Create product with given body:
    {
        "name": "Nokia 6300",
        "price": 130,
        "amount": 200
    }

4. PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/products/2
   Update product with id=2;
   Changed price(650) and amount(520):
    {
        "productId": 2,
        "name": "Samsung S20",
        "price": 650,
        "amount": 520
    }

5. DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/v1/products/3
   Delete product with id=3

   Status: 204 No Content

-------

1. Added new Modules(Warehouse & Order)
2. Created their repositories and controllers
3. Added Flyway maven dependencies and created db.migration directories
4. Added V1__Init_CreateTables.sql and V2__Init_Insert.sql files
5. Launched flyway migration


-------
3/16/2022

1. Added new Modules(User, Role, Status, Permission)
2. Added new classes related to Spring Security(services, controllers)
3. Now user has to login with its own username and password which is available in database
4. User can register

Overall the program has a lot of things to fix, but it has spring security features where by logining you are able to do only things which are permitted for your user type
